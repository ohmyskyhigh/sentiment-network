# sentiment-network
This project is using IMDB movie review to train the computer, so that it can distinguish whether a review is good or bad. This is 
one of the mini-project from my Udacity online course

NOTE:
using 
<conda create -f sentimental>
to import the environment first, otherwise you are going to spend a lot of time updating libs.
